# Introduction
This contains helper files to improve your productivity while doing leetcode questions.

# Background
I was doing leet-code questions for topic Tree. And while testing coding and debugging  in local (Leetcode free have pending queues which takes some time).
I created few C++ functions to create trees from the input.
As in case of leetcode, function takes level order array as input, and creates a tree out of it.
Current implementation is for Binary Tree.
Also added functions to print Tree in level order traversal and check the output.
Though improvements can be made this gets the job done.
